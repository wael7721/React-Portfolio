# ðŸ“˜ Advanced React Project (Meta Front-End Developer Certificate)

This project was created as part of the Advanced React course from the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.

It demonstrates the use of advanced React patterns including:

- Custom Hooks
- Formik for form management and validation
- Chakra UI for component styling
- Context API for global state (Alert System)
- Async form submission simulation
- Schema validation with Yup

- **Global Alert Context** (`useAlertContext`)
- **Formik-powered Form**
